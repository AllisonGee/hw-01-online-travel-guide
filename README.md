## Wireframe

- Before you start building your site, you will create a wireframe similar to the one found [here](https://fewd20190318.github.io/04-css-basics/code-along/) to help you plan your layout.


## Website Requirements

The website should meet the following criteria:

- The site should have at least three (3) pages

    1. Homepage: This page should provide an overview of the destination such as location, history, population, etc

    2. Things to Do: This page should include a list of things to do

    3. Places to eat: This page should include a list of the best places to eat

- A navigation menu (displayed on every page) that allows visitors to easily navigate between all 3 pages

- Code for the site should make good use of indentation

- Site should include at least five (5) images (it is up to you where the images are placed)

- Site should have at least one link to an external website

- Site should use an external style sheet and incorporate at least 5 different css rules (of your own choosing)

- Organization of your code (files and folders) should follow best practices (i.e. separate folder for css and images)
